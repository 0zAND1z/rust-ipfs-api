## Rust IPFS API Library

```toml
[dependencies]
ipfs-api = "0.4.0"
```

### Goals

  * Provide a full implementation of the HTTP API specification described here: https://ipfs.io/docs/api/.
  * Provide a partial implementation of the `ipfs` cli.
  * Write idiomatic rust, and make use of rust's memory safety features.
  * Provide support for `0.4.*`, with possible backwards compatibility features.
  * Provide cross platform support for Linux, OSX, and Windows.
